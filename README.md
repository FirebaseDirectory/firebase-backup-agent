# firebase-backup-agent
Yet another Firebase Backupp agent!

Ths Node.js program downloads the latest version of your Firebase JSON (or actually any file...) and backs it up in a folder specified by you.

## Install ##

For this program to work you will need Node.js and nothing else.

It is recommended that you use this program as a scheduled task in your system so that it checks for changes periodically.

## Usage ##

Before making backups we need to setup our config.sjon file. This file contains the URL we're loading JSON from and folder where we will save it.

- Create a file named `config.json` in the program's directory and paste the following in it:

	    {
	        "url": "https://amber-inferno-1234.firebaseio.com//.json",
	        "dest": {
	            "type": "filesys",
	            "folder": "backups",
	            "pattern": "firebase-"
	        }
	    }

- Replace `amber-inferno-1234` by your instance's `amber-inferno-id` that appears in your browser's URL while browsing in Firebase's admin app.
- You can customize the destination folder by editing the `folder` field, or just leave it as-is.
-You can customize the filenames generated by the program by changing the `pattern` field.

To run this program open a command prompt in this file's folder and type

    node program.js

## Schedulling backups ##

It is recommended that you use this program as a scheduled task in your system so that it 
checks for changes periodically.

- On Windows you can simply start Task Scheduler and create a new task pointing `run.cmd` as your executable/script. Don't forget to set this file's folder as the working directory.

- On Linux you can put `run.sh`in your system's `crontab`.
